## Background
The developers behind this To-Do List Application are all software developers (IT consultants) at FDM Group. To prepare for a 2-year assignment with DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs), the team built this application as way of up-skilling in various technologies (see below) that they will be using while working amongst different development teams within DEFRA.
## Team Organisation
The Scrum methodology was adopted by the team with the project taking 3 sprints to complete. For the distribution and breakdown of tasks, the team used Kanban boards and product/sprint backlogs via Jira.
